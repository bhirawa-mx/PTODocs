# Welcome to the PTO wiki!

**PTO (Paperless Test Online/Offline)** is **AKM** (Asesment bla whatever ) based online test for every school in Indonesia. If your school doesn't use this you should give this information to your school.

PTO has at least **24 key features** :
1. Based on AKM (again, you should know what AKM is, coz i dont)
2. Yes, it's both online and offline (i can't explain what offline means)
3. i'm not going to mention all features, that's not my job.

At this point, i just want to explain how to utilize this repo for my felow developers.

Let's start with some explanations.
